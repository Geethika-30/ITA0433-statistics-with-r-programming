LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS IN R
Exercise
1.	Using linear regression analysis establish a relationship between height and weight of a person using the input vector given below.
# Values of height
151, 174, 138, 186, 128, 136, 179, 163, 152, 131
# Values of weight.
63, 81, 56, 91, 47, 57, 76, 72, 62, 48
Predict the weight of a person with height 170. Visualize the regression graphically.
x=c(151, 174, 138, 186, 128, 136, 179, 163, 152, 131)
y=c(63, 81, 56, 91, 47, 57, 76, 72, 62, 48)
z=lm(y~x)
a=data.frame(x=170)
result=predict(z,a)
print(result)
plot(y,x,col = "blue",main = "Height & Weight Regression",
     abline(lm(x~y)),cex = 1.3,pch = 16,xlab = "Weight in Kg",ylab = "Height in cm")


2.	Download the Dataset "water" From Rdataset Link.Find out whether there is a linear relation between attributes"mortality" and"hardness" by plot function.Fit the Data into the Linear Regression model.Predict the mortality for the hardness=88
dataset<-read.csv("water.csv")
View(dataset)
plot(dataset$mortality, dataset$hardness, col="RED", main=  "Linear Regression" , 
      xlab = "mortality", ylab= "hardness")
rel<-lm(mortality~hardness,data = dataset)

A<- data.frame(hardness=88)
Res<- predict(rel, A)
print(Res)
output:
print(Res)

MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSIS IN R  
Exercise:
1.Generate a multiple regression model using the built in dataset mtcars.It gives a comparison between different car models in terms of mileage per gallon (mpg), cylinder displacement("disp"), horse power("hp"), weight of the car("wt") and some more parameters.
Establish the relationship between "mpg" as a response variable with "disp","hp" and "wt" as predictor variables. Predict the mileage of the car with dsp=221,hp=102 and wt=2.91.
data<-mtcars
input<-data[,c("mpg", "disp", "hp","wt")]
model <- lm(mpg~disp+hp+wt,data=input)
print(model)
A<- coef(model)[1]
print(A)
xdisp<- coef(model)[2]
xhp<- coef(model)[3]
xwt<-coef(model)[4]
y = A+xdisp*221+xhp*102+xwt*2.91
print(y)
output:
(Intercept) 
   22.65987

2. Consider the data set "delivery" available in the R environment. It gives a deliverytime (“delTime”)of production materials(number of productions “n.prod”) with the given distance(“distance”) to reach the destination place.
a)Create  the model  to establish the relationship between "delTime" as a response variable with "n.prod" and "distance"  as predictor variables.
b)Predict the delTime for the given number of production(“n.prod”)=9 and distance(“distance”)=450


LOGISTIC  REGRESSION ANALYSIS IN R
Exercise
1. Create a logistic regression model using the “mtcars” data set with the information given below.
The in-built data set "mtcars" describes different models of a car with their various engine specifications. In "mtcars" data set, the transmission mode (automatic or manual) is described by the column am which is a binary value (0 or 1). Create a logistic regression model between the columns "am" and 3 other columns - hp, wt and cyl.
model <- glm(am ~ hp + wt + cyl, data = mtcars, family = binomial)
summary(model)
output:
Call:
glm(formula = am ~ hp + wt + cyl, family = binomial, data = mtcars)

POISSON  REGRESSION ANALYSIS IN R
Exercise :
1. Create a Poisson regression model using the in-built data set “warpbreaks” with information given below.
In-built data set "warpbreaks” describes the effect of wool type (A or B) and tension (low, medium or high) on the number of warp breaks per loom. Consider "breaks" as the response variable which is a count of number of breaks. The wool "type" and "tension" are taken as predictor variables.
model <- glm(breaks ~ wool + tension, data = warpbreaks, family = poisson)
summary(model)
